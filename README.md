# createURL

CreateURL is an automatic url generator, it converts any word you feed it with into a clickable url.
Type whatever you can think of into the text-box, then you be immediately prompted to type in any high level domain of your choice.
when you're done, then some village magic is done and a clickable url will be created for you!

Important: If you type in a word that has no connection to an actual domain name, clicking on the generated url will result to an error message
